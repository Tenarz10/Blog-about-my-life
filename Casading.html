    <h1>CSS Styles</h1>
    <h2>Introduction to Basic CSS Styling</h2>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is an essential technology for designing and styling web pages. It allows developers to control the appearance of HTML elements, making web content visually appealing and user-friendly. CSS provides various styling options, such as colors, typography, layouts, and positioning, which enhance the user experience. Among the fundamental aspects of CSS styling are colors, fonts, the box model, and positioning techniques like floats. Understanding these core concepts is crucial for anyone learning web development.</p>

    <h2>Colors in CSS</h2>
    <p>One of the most fundamental aspects of CSS is the ability to apply colors to different elements. Colors play a vital role in web design, affecting readability, aesthetics, and user engagement. CSS provides multiple methods for defining colors, including named colors, hexadecimal codes, RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values, HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness), and RGBA for transparency effects. Background colors can be applied to elements, and the text color can be adjusted to create contrast. By carefully selecting and combining colors, designers can create visually appealing interfaces that align with branding guidelines and accessibility standards.</p>

    <h2>Font Styling and Text Appearance</h2>
    <p>Typography is another essential component of CSS styling. The font-family property allows developers to specify different fonts, ensuring that text appears consistent across different devices and browsers. Font size and weight can also be adjusted to improve readability and emphasize important content. CSS provides alignment properties, such as left, right, center, and justified text alignment, to control the positioning of text within elements. Additionally, developers can apply text transformations, spacing, and decorative effects to enhance the presentation of textual content. Proper typography contributes to a websiteâ€™s usability, ensuring that information is easily readable and visually appealing.</p>

    <h2>The CSS Box Model: Margins, Padding, and Borders</h2>
    <p>Every HTML element on a webpage follows the CSS box model, which consists of four key components: content, padding, border, and margin. The content is the actual text or image inside an element. Padding creates space between the content and the border, while the border surrounds the element and can be styled in various ways. Margins define the space between elements, helping to structure layouts and prevent elements from overlapping. Understanding how the box model works is essential for managing spacing and ensuring a well-structured design. By adjusting margins and padding, developers can create a visually balanced layout that enhances user experience.</p>
