    <h1>What I Have Learnt</h1>
    <p>I met my boss and he taught me so many things on front end. It is the combination of HTML, CSS and Javascript.They give structure, beautify and make it function respectively.</p>
    <P>Over the weeks, I had an insightful session with my boss, where he guided me through the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. The training helped me understand how to structure and style web pages effectively, laying a strong foundation for front-end development.</P>

    <h2>Learning HTML</h2>
    <p>We started with HTML, where my boss explained its role in structuring a webpage. He introduced essential elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, links, images, and forms. We also discussed the importance of semantic HTML, using tags like <b>header, navigaion and sections</b>, and to improve accessibility and code organization. By the end of this segment, I had a clear understanding of how to properly structure content for a webpage.</p>
        
    <h2>Exploring CSS</h2>
    <p>After mastering HTML basics, we moved on to CSS, which is responsible for styling web pages. My boss explained different ways to apply CSS—inline, internal, and external styles—and highlighted the advantages of using external stylesheets for maintainability. During my session with my boss, I learned key CSS concepts, including the Box Model, which defines how content, padding, borders, and margins affect element spacing. I also explored Selectors, using class, ID, and tag targeting for efficient styling. Additionally, I gained insights into Typography & Colors for enhancing design, Layouts & Positioning with the use of Floats and text align. Fonts, with learning the different font family and sizes we have. These lessons have greatly improved my understanding of CSS and front-end development.</p>
    
    <h2>Practical Application & Feedback</h2>
    <P>To solidify my understanding, we worked on a hands-on project where I created a simple webpage using HTML and CSS. I applied different styling techniques and received constructive feedback from my boss, which helped me refine my approach and improve my coding efficiency.</P>
        
    <p>This session was incredibly beneficial, deepening my understanding of front-end development and giving me the confidence to build structured and visually appealing webpages. I look forward to applying these new skills to future projects and continuing to enhance my knowledge in web development.</P>
